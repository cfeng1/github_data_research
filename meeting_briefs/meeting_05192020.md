## Future Plans 

- Data Collection:
	- unreleased Python projects: modify query, collect more packages
		- collect number of issues, pull requests as well?
		- collect author commits outside of Python packages?
	- released Python projects:
		- need permission from Bogdan to upload table of PyPI? alternative way to get around?

- Data Cleaning:
	- What to do with authors with only 1-2 commits? projects with 1-2 commits?
    - What to do with authors that commit only for 1-2 months? These authors can be very intensive, i.e. make a lot of commmits in a month, but commit for a short period of time. 
	- Delete observations with weird timestamps
